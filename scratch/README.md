# Project #3: Turing Machine Simulator

* Author: Jordan Pittman, Caleb Pollock
* Class: CS361 Section 1
* Semester: Spring 2025

## Overview

This Java program simulates a deterministic Turing Machine with a bi infinite tape, parsing the machine's encoding and input string from a file. It executes the machine's transitions, halts at the accepting state, and outputs the content of visited tape cells.

Overall, this project went really smooth due to Caleb's work he put in. After reviewing the code, I supplied the initial tape string loading functionality which distributes the intput across TMBlocks of size 256. Due to the nature of the project, I created a new branch to test this without affecting the main codebase.
